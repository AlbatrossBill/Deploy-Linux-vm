# Building Linux system on VM / windows10 x64

## My Hardware

**System**        Windows10 x64

**CPU**	          Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz 3.20 GHz

**GPU** NVIDIA    GeForce GTX 1060 6GB Zotac

**Motherboard**   ASUSTek H110M-A/DP Intel H1108GB 

**Memory**        Kingston DDR4-2400(1200MHz) 8GB * 2

**SSD**           ADATA SP550 223GB & WDC 931 GB

As you can see my hardware is kind of 'worn-out', but install an linux enviorment on my VM is still work pretty well. So don't worry about your device, it can't cause big problem, unless you can't split 2GB Ram/Memory or 2 cores from CPU or about 20-50GB capacity of hard drive to the Linux system. Will...If this is really happened. I have two ways for you. One is endure the lag from vm, one is update your hardware(Please do this, now is 20 Century, Ryzen and Intel not expensive, also Memory as well. If you don't have 50GB empty capacity in your ssd, please..please, look out side the window, there is a really and great world.)

# First step: 
Download Ubuntu or any other iso. Because of Ubuntu is the kindest to nooby. So I will introduce it base on Ubuntu.
